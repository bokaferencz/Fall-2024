# Background

Your Cuban uncle sets up a cocktail bar in downtown Budapest. He has a secret list of cocktails that he would like to serve in the bar. He asks you to do create a few lists and tables to set up the shop. As your uncle is a secret hipster, he has a dataset on Github that you can use for the task!

Note: There are several different ways to solve these tasks, feel free to come up with your own.

## 1. Read the data

Read the cocktail dataset from: <https://github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance> You can also find the codebook there.

```{r}

cocktail_data <- read_tsv("/Users/ferenczboroka/Desktop/R-project/Fall-2024/data/cocktail_data.tsv")
cocktail_data

```

## 2. Transform the data table and clean the ingredient variable!

The ingredients are currently in a single cell for each cocktail. It would be better to put them in separate rows. Also, the variable should be cleaned of all quantities (e.g. 1/2 oz, 2 dashes, etc.), and the indicator of alcohol content (e.g. 47.3% abv). You will need to use this cleaned table in later tasks.

```{r}
#separating into rows
cocktail_data_clean <- cocktail_data %>%
  mutate(
    ingredients = str_replace_all(ingredients, "<br>", "<br/>"),
    ingredients = str_replace_all(ingredients, "<b4/>", "<br/>")  
  ) %>%
  separate_rows(ingredients, sep = "<br/>")  # Split into separate rows 

#cleaning the ingredients
cocktail_data_clean <- cocktail_data_clean %>%
  mutate(
    ingredients = str_remove_all(ingredients, "\\d+\\s*\\/?\\d*\\s*(oz|dashes?|drops?|tsp|tbsp|cl|ml|bsp|parts?)"),  # Remove quantities
    ingredients = str_remove_all(ingredients, "\\(.*?abv\\)"),  # Remove abv
    ingredients = str_remove_all(ingredients, "\\b\\d+(\\.\\d+)?(?!-)(?=\\s|$)"),  # Remove standalone numbers and decimals (not followed by hyphen)
    ingredients = str_remove_all(ingredients, "\\d+\\.\\s*"),  # Remove numbers with dot and space
    ingredients = str_remove_all(ingredients, "\\s*\\.\\s*"),  # Remove standalone dots with spaces around
    ingredients = str_trim(ingredients)  # Trim whitespace
  )


```

## 3. All ingredients in alphabetical order

Before opening the bar, you need to find a reliable supplier that has all the ingredients. You need to send a list of all possible ingredients you will need. They don't need the quantities (i.e. how many of these are needed), just the names of the ingredients.

```{r}
# Create a sorted list of ingredients
ingredients_list <- cocktail_data_clean %>%
  dplyr::select(ingredients) %>%      # dplyr:: to resolve a conflict with another package loaded in my environment
  distinct() %>%               # Get ingredients
  arrange(ingredients) %>%     # Sort in alphabetical order
  pull(ingredients)            # Extract the vector

#print
ingredients_list
```

## 4. Number of unique ingredients

How many different ingredients you will need?

```{r}
#calcualte the number of ingredients
number_of_ingredients <- length(ingredients_list)

#print
number_of_ingredients
```

## 5. What are the top 10 ingredients?

What are the 10 most frequently used ingredients? If there are ties, you can list more than 10.

```{r}


# Count the occurrences of each ingredient
ingredient_counts <- cocktail_data_clean %>%
  count(ingredients, sort = TRUE)  # Count occurrences, sorted in descending order


# Determine the maximum count for the 10th ingredient
max_count_10th <- ingredient_counts %>%
  slice(10) %>%  # Get the 10th row
  pull(n)        # Extract the count value

# Filter to get the top 10 and any ties with the 10th ingredient
top_ingredients <- ingredient_counts %>%
  filter(n >= max_count_10th) %>%  # Keep ingredients with count >= count of the 10th
  arrange(desc(n))                  # Sort by count in descending order

# Print the top ingredients
top_ingredients
```

## 6. Which cocktail(s) has/have the most ingredients?

Count the number of ingredients and filter all the cocktails that has that many.

```{r}


# Count the number of ingredients for each cocktail
cocktail_counts <- cocktail_data_clean %>%
  group_by(name) %>%  
  summarise(num_ingredients = n())

# Identify the maximum number of ingredients
max_ingredients <- max(cocktail_counts$num_ingredients)

# Filter cocktails with the maximum number of ingredients
cocktails_with_most_ingredients <- cocktail_counts %>%
  filter(num_ingredients == max_ingredients)

# Print
cocktails_with_most_ingredients

```

## 7. How many ingredients appear in only one cocktail (rare ingredient)?

```{r}

# Count how many cocktails each ingredient appears in
ingredient_counts <- cocktail_data_clean %>%
  group_by(ingredients) %>%  
  summarise(num_cocktails = n_distinct(name)) 

#  Filter for ingredients that appear in only one cocktail
rare_ingredients <- ingredient_counts %>%
  filter(num_cocktails == 1)
rare_ingredients

#  Count the number of rare ingredients
num_rare_ingredients <- nrow(rare_ingredients)

# Print
num_rare_ingredients
```

## 8. Which cocktail has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail?

```{r}

#  Create a vector of rare ingredients
rare_ingredient_list <- rare_ingredients$ingredients
rare_ingredient_list

# Initialize an empty vector to store cocktail names with rare ingredients
cocktails_with_rare_ingredients <- c()

# Loop through the rows of cocktail_data_clean to check if any ingredient matches the rare_ingredient_list exactly
for (i in 1:nrow(cocktail_data_clean)) {
  # Get the ingredient for the current row
  ingredient <- cocktail_data_clean$ingredients[i]
  
  # Check if the ingredient matches any ingredient in rare_ingredient_list exactly
  if (ingredient %in% rare_ingredient_list) {
    # Get the cocktail name for the current row
    cocktail_name <- cocktail_data_clean$name[i]
    
    # Add the cocktail name only if it's not already in the result vector
    if (!(cocktail_name %in% cocktails_with_rare_ingredients)) {
      cocktails_with_rare_ingredients <- c(cocktails_with_rare_ingredients, cocktail_name)
    }
  }
}

#cocktails with ingredients that appear only once
cocktails_with_rare_ingredients


#there is a 'saline' and 'simple' string in the ingredients columns- and I don't know if I should've removed those- those  derived from 'saline solution' and 'simple syrup' I guess
```

## 9. What are the cocktails without rare ingredients?

```{r}

#  Get all cocktail names from the cocktail_data dataframe
all_cocktails <- cocktail_data$name

#  Find cocktails in the cocktail_data name column that are not in cocktails_with_rare_ingredients
non_rare_cocktails <- setdiff(all_cocktails, cocktails_with_rare_ingredients)

#  Optionally, filter the cocktail_data dataframe to get the rows for non-rare cocktails
non_rare_cocktails_data <- cocktail_data %>% 
  filter(name %in% non_rare_cocktails)

# Print cocktails without rare ingredients
non_rare_cocktails

```

## 10. Create a cheat sheet for the bartender!

Create a matrix that shows all cocktail names as rows and all ingredients as columns. When a cocktail requires an ingredient, there should be an "X" in the cell, otherwise, the cell should remain empty. Example:

```{r}
# Extracting the unique cocktail names and unique ingredients
unique_cocktails <- unique(cocktail_data_clean$name)
unique_ingredients <- ingredient_counts$ingredients

#  Creating an empty cheat sheet dataframe with cocktails as rows and ingredients as columns
cheat_sheet <- data.frame(matrix(ncol = length(unique_ingredients), nrow = length(unique_cocktails)))
colnames(cheat_sheet) <- unique_ingredients
rownames(cheat_sheet) <- unique_cocktails

# Cheat sheet
for (i in seq_len(nrow(cocktail_data_clean))) {
  # Get the current cocktail name and ingredient
  cocktail_for_cheat_sheet <- cocktail_data_clean$name[i]
  ingredient_for_cheat_sheet <- cocktail_data_clean$ingredients[i]
  
  # If the ingredient is in the unique_ingredients list, mark 'x' in the corresponding cell
  if (ingredient_for_cheat_sheet %in% unique_ingredients) {
    cheat_sheet[cocktail_for_cheat_sheet, ingredient_for_cheat_sheet] <- "x"
  }
}

# Replacing NAs with empty strings for better readability
cheat_sheet[is.na(cheat_sheet)] <- ""

cheat_sheet

```


Congrats, the bar is now officially open!
